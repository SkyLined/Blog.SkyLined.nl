Browser Security Whitepaper
===========================

Synopsis
--------
Over the past few months, I have been [working together] on a team of four on a
[Browser Security white paper][]. Specifically, we collected, analyzed and
summarized all potentially relevant information related to browser security.

Our target audience is IT managers and security experts that want to decide
which browser to deploy on their networks for their employees to use. The
paper should help them make an informed decision about which browser is best
suited for their specific needs and protects them best against the specific
risks they face.

Browser Security
----------------
We looked at Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, as well as Google Chrome, as
these three are the most likely choices for our target audience. We would have
liked to include other browsers but time and budget constraints unfortunately
meant we had to keep the list short: you would not believe the amount of time
we needed to go through *all* security features that modern web browsers
implement, and analyze the *many*, *many* features they have for potential
security risks.

Perhaps obviously, we found that the modern browsers have a lot more security
technologies built-in then they used to but that they also have a lot more
"surface area". New security technologies and web features are introduced
regularly. Implementing each one adds more code that can potentially mitigate
security issues or introduce security vulnerabilities. We found both Microsoft
Edge and Google Chrome to have state-of-the-art security, while Microsoft
Internet Explorer lagged behind these two. In our opinion Google Chrome is
slightly more secure overall, but I encourage you to have a look at the data
and decide for yourself. After all, the best choice for your organisation
depends highly on your personal needs and risks.

Credits
-------
This project was run by [x41][], and headed by my good friend Markus Vervier.
I really enjoyed this opportunity to work with a team of people who were very
skilled in various areas of computer security. We hit that sweet spot where
every team member has unique knowledge and skills that, when combined, covered
every aspect of this project.

The project was sponsored by Google, who generously accepted our proposal to
write this paper and let us work on our terms, did not interfere with our
process and did not attempt to influence our conclusions.

If you are interested in setting up a similar project and want to hire me or a
team of security researchers to thoroughly analyze the security of one or more
software products, you can [email me][] or [contact x41][].
