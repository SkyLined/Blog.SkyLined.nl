Over the past few months, I have been [working together] on a team of four on a
[Browser Security white paper][]. Specifically, we collected, analyzed and
summarized all potentially relevant information related to browser security.

Our target audience is IT managers and security experts that want to decide
which browser to deploy on their networks for their employees to use. The
paper should help them make an informed decision about which browser is best
suited for their specific needs and protects them best against the specific
risks they face.
